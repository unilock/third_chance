# Third Chance

Basic one-hit protection.

Damage threshold is configurable in `.minecraft/config/third_chance.toml`. Defaults to 75% of the player's maximum health.

Ignored damage types are controlled by the `#third_chance:ignored` tag. Defaults to entity cramming, fall damage, falling out of the world, and suffocation.
